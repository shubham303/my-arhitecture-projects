"""Session — thin state holder that delegates to the analytics layer.

This class is deliberately thin: it owns state (the store, registered models,
job registry) and delegates all computation to the analytics modules. It contains
no algorithms.

Note: predict() lives on the returned TrainedModel, NOT on Session. Session keeps
a registry of models (self.models[name]) so the agent can reference one by name.
